# Italian Draughts - Game

## Introduction
This repository was created fot the "Software Development Methods" exam at the University of Trieste.

The goal of this project is to develop a game using Test-Driven development (TDD) principles to iteratively improve the codebaase and follow the S.O.L.I.D. paradigm.
In addition, Agile methodologies were used to manage the project in a collaborative group environment.

The game implemented is the Italian Draughts (checkers).

This project is built using Gradle and programmed in Java.
